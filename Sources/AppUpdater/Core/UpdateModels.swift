/// In release builds, a malformed `repo` string passed to `AppUpdater.init`
/// (one that causes `URL(string:)` to return `nil`) surfaces as
/// `.networkError(underlying: URLError(.badURL))`. This is a semantic
/// mismatch — it is a configuration error, not a connectivity failure.

    /// also surfaces as `.networkError(underlying: URLError(.badURL))` — see

    ///
    /// This has been raised twice across review cycles, in opposite directions.
    /// The correct spelling is `any Error & Sendable`. Here is why:
    ///
    /// `ReleaseFetchError` is itself `Sendable`. A `Sendable` enum with a
    /// non-`Sendable` associated value is a data race — the enum can cross
    /// actor boundaries while the associated error cannot. Bare `Error` makes
    /// the `Sendable` conformance on the *enum* unchecked: Swift trusts it
    /// rather than enforcing it, so a caller constructing `.networkError` with
    /// a non-`Sendable` custom error silently violates strict concurrency
    /// without a compile-time warning. `any Error & Sendable` makes the
    /// conformance sound at the type level.
    ///
    /// All construction sites in this codebase (`URLSession` throws,
    /// `JSONDecoder` throws, `URLError(.badURL)` fallback) already produce
    /// `Sendable`-safe errors, so no call site changes are required.

    /// prevents a class of future bugs rather than limiting current callers.
