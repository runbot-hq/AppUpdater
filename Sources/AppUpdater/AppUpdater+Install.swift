extension AppUpdater {

    /// Unzips the cached update zip, replaces the running `.app` bundle, and
    /// relaunches the new version.
    ///
    /// ## Flow
    /// 1. Unzip the cached zip into a temporary directory via `/usr/bin/ditto`.
    /// 2. Locate the `.app` bundle inside the unzipped contents.
    /// 3. Replace the running bundle via `FileManager.replaceItem` (atomic swap).
    /// 4. Relaunch the new binary with `/usr/bin/open`.
    /// 5. Terminate this process via `NSApp.terminate`.
    ///
    /// On any failure the function calls `state.setUpdateFailed()` and returns
    /// without terminating — the user is left with the running version and the
    /// host should direct them to re-run the original `curl` install command.
    ///
    /// ## ⚠️ `setUpdateFailed()` is NOT a silent failure — read before flagging ⚠️
    ///
    /// Reviewers sometimes flag the `replaceItem` catch block as a silent UX
    /// failure because the UI switches from "Install & Relaunch" to a state
    /// that surfaces the `curl` install command with no further explanation.
    /// This is intentional and correct: the curl path is how every user
    /// installed the app in the first place and it is the only safe recovery
    /// path. **Do NOT add a browser-download fallback** — downloading via a
    /// browser stamps the `.app` with `com.apple.quarantine`, which triggers
    /// Gatekeeper and breaks the install.
    ///
    /// **Do NOT add `NSFileWriteNoPermissionError` special-casing** or a
    /// separate permission state. Distinguishing permission errors from other
    /// `replaceItem` failures would add complexity for a case the curl fallback
    /// already handles correctly.
    ///
    /// ## `isInstalling` reset strategy — intentional, not an oversight
    ///
    /// `isInstalling` is set to `true` at the start and cleared **only in
    /// failure branches**. It is deliberately NOT reset on the success path:
    /// `NSApp.terminate(nil)` fires synchronously after `open -n` is launched, so
    /// the process exits before any subsequent UI tick can observe
    /// `isInstalling == true`. Resetting it would be a no-op and could introduce
    /// a brief window where a second tap slips through.
    ///
    /// If `applicationShouldTerminate` ever returns `.terminateLater` or
    /// `.terminateCancel`, the process would survive with `isInstalling`
    /// permanently `true`. Hosts that do this must add `isInstalling = false`
    /// before the `NSApp.terminate(nil)` call.
    ///
    /// ## Why `NSApp.terminate(nil)` and not `exit(0)`
    ///
    /// `NSApp.terminate` is the idiomatic AppKit shutdown path: it fires
    /// `applicationWillTerminate`, drains the run loop, and lets the system clean
    /// up before the process exits. `exit(0)` belongs to the detached
    /// helper-process self-update pattern, which is not used here.
    ///
    /// - Parameter state: The host update-state object driving the UI. On failure
    ///   `setUpdateFailed()` is called so the host can surface the curl install command.
