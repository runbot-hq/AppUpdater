extension AppUpdater {

    /// Unzips the cached update zip, replaces the running `.app` bundle, and
    /// relaunches the new version.
    ///
    /// ## Flow
    /// 1. Unzip the cached zip into a temporary directory via `/usr/bin/ditto`.
    /// 2. Locate the `.app` bundle inside the unzipped contents.
    /// 3. (Optional) If `skipCodeSignValidation` is `false`: verify that the
    ///    running bundle and the downloaded bundle share the same `codesign`
    ///    `Authority=` identity. A mismatch calls `setUpdateFailed()` and aborts.
    /// 4. Replace the running bundle via `FileManager.replaceItem` (atomic swap).
    /// 5. Relaunch the new binary with `/usr/bin/open`.
    /// 6. Delete the zip (spent — relaunch confirmed).
    /// 7. Terminate this process via `NSApp.terminate`.
    ///
    /// On any failure the function calls `state.setUpdateFailed()` and returns
    /// without terminating — the user is left with the running version and the
    /// host should direct them to re-run the original `curl` install command.
    ///
    /// **Exception — post-replaceItem relaunch failure:** if `replaceItem`
    /// succeeds but `open -n` throws, the new binary is already on disk.
    /// `clearDownloadState()` is called instead of `setUpdateFailed()` so the
    /// host shows a neutral state. The zip is NOT deleted in this branch, but
    /// UserDefaults were cleared in step 2, so `rehydrateCachedUpdateIfNewer()`
    /// cannot find the path key on next launch. The zip is left on disk but is
    /// unreachable via rehydration — it will be swept by `purgeStaleZips` on
    /// the next launch. The user relaunches manually to run the new binary that
    /// is already installed.
    ///
    /// ## Why curl is the only correct install and recovery path
    ///
    /// This app is **ad-hoc signed** — it carries a local code signature but
    /// has NOT been submitted to Apple for notarisation. Gatekeeper will block
    /// any `.app` that arrives with the `com.apple.quarantine` extended
    /// attribute set, because without a notarisation ticket it cannot verify
    /// the binary.
    ///
    /// `com.apple.quarantine` is stamped by any process that has opted in via
    /// `LSFileQuarantineEnabled = YES` in its `Info.plist` — this includes
    /// every browser (Safari, Chrome, Firefox) and the macOS Finder copy
    /// operation when dragging from a Downloads folder. A `curl` invocation
    /// does **not** set `LSFileQuarantineEnabled`, so the downloaded `.app`
    /// arrives clean, Gatekeeper never inspects it, and the install succeeds.
    ///
    /// Consequences for this updater:
    /// - `URLSession` (used by `AppUpdater`) does NOT set the quarantine bit
    ///   because the host omits `LSFileQuarantineEnabled`. The in-app download
    ///   is therefore safe.
    /// - **Do NOT add a browser-download fallback.** A browser-downloaded
    ///   `.app` will be quarantine-stamped and Gatekeeper will block it on
    ///   launch, leaving the user with a broken install.
    /// - **Do NOT add a Finder/drag-install path.** Same reason.
    /// - The curl install command is the only other safe path: it mirrors the
    ///   original first-install flow that every user already completed
    ///   successfully.
    ///
    /// ## ⚠️ `setUpdateFailed()` is NOT a silent failure — read before flagging ⚠️
    ///
    /// Reviewers sometimes flag the `replaceItem` catch block as a silent UX
    /// failure because the UI switches from "Install & Relaunch" to a state
    /// that surfaces the `curl` install command with no further explanation.
    /// This is intentional and correct — see the curl distribution model
    /// section above for the full rationale.
    ///
    /// **Do NOT add `NSFileWriteNoPermissionError` special-casing** or a
    /// separate permission state. Distinguishing permission errors from other
    /// `replaceItem` failures would add complexity for a case the curl fallback
    /// already handles correctly.
    ///
    /// ## `isInstalling` reset strategy — intentional, not an oversight
    ///
    /// `isInstalling` is set to `true` at the start and cleared **only in
    /// failure branches**. It is deliberately NOT reset on the success path:
    /// `NSApp.terminate(nil)` fires synchronously after `open -n` is launched, so
    /// the process exits before any subsequent UI tick can observe
    /// `isInstalling == true`. Resetting it would be a no-op and could introduce
    /// a brief window where a second tap slips through.
    ///
    /// - Parameter state: The host update-state object driving the UI.

    /// The sequence is deliberately:
    ///
    /// ```
    /// 1. replaceItem    — new .app atomically on disk
    /// 2. clearCachedDefaults()  — UserDefaults wiped

    /// 6. NSApp.terminate(nil)   — this process exits
    /// ```
    ///
    /// ### Why the zip is deleted AFTER `open -n` succeeds (step 5, not earlier)
    ///
    /// **The decision:** zip deletion is gated on `relaunchTask.run()` succeeding.
    ///
    /// **Pros of this ordering:**
    /// - If `run()` throws (see failure scenarios below), the zip is still on
    ///   disk. However, UserDefaults were cleared in step 2, so
    ///   `rehydrateCachedUpdateIfNewer()` cannot find the path key on next launch.
    ///   The zip is an orphan — unreachable via rehydration, swept by
    ///   `purgeStaleZips` on the next launch. The new binary is already installed;
    ///   the user relaunches manually.
    /// - The zip being present is harmless — it lives in the app's scoped
    ///   Caches directory and is < the size of the app bundle itself.
    /// - The ordering matches the logical invariant: the zip is spent only
    ///   when we are certain the handoff to the new process worked.
    ///
    /// **Cons / known side effects:**
    /// - If `NSApp.terminate(nil)` is somehow skipped (it cannot be — it is
    ///   unconditional and synchronous after `run()` succeeds), the zip would
    ///   survive this process. On next launch `purgeStaleZips` sweeps it.
    ///   This is a safe, recoverable state.
    /// - There is a very brief window between `run()` returning and
    ///   `removeItem(zipURL)` where the zip exists on disk while the new
    ///   process is starting. This is not a correctness issue — the zip is
    ///   in a scoped Caches directory, not user-visible.
    ///
    /// **Why the previous ordering (zip before open) was wrong:**
    /// - Deleting the zip before `run()` meant a `run()` failure left the user
    ///   with `clearDownloadState()` called, no zip on disk, and no recovery
    ///   path short of a full re-download. That is a worse failure mode for
    ///   what is already an edge case.
    ///
    /// ### Failure scenarios for `relaunchTask.run()`
    ///
    /// `Process.run()` throws `CocoaError` / `POSIXError` if:
    /// - `executableURL` points at a non-existent binary (would be our bug)
    /// - A sandboxing restriction blocks `Process` from spawning (RunBot is
    ///   not sandboxed — this path is currently unreachable)
    /// - `/usr/bin/open` is missing or corrupt (essentially impossible on macOS)
    ///
    /// In all cases the new `.app` is already on disk (step 1 succeeded).
    /// UserDefaults are cleared (step 2). The zip is still on disk but orphaned
    /// (unreachable via rehydration). The catch block calls
    /// `clearDownloadState()` (NOT `setUpdateFailed()` — see below) and logs
    /// a distinct error message. The user relaunches manually.
    ///
    /// ### Why the post-open-failure branch calls `clearDownloadState()` not `setUpdateFailed()`
    ///
    /// REVIEWER: Do NOT change the post-open-failure catch to call `setUpdateFailed()`.
    ///
    /// `setUpdateFailed()` surfaces the curl-install fallback UI, which implies
    /// the user needs to reinstall. They do NOT — the new binary is already on
    /// disk from step 1. Showing the curl-install UI here would be actively
    /// misleading. `clearDownloadState()` resets in-memory state to neutral;
    /// the user sees no install affordance but also no false alarm. The distinct
    /// log message in Console.app (`open -n failed after successful replaceItem`)
    /// is the diagnostic signal for this branch.
    ///
    /// ### Zip is NOT deleted in the post-open-failure catch branch
    ///
    /// REVIEWER: Do NOT add `removeItem(zipURL)` to the post-open-failure catch.
    ///
    /// The zip is intentionally left on disk if `run()` throws. It is an orphan
    /// at this point (UserDefaults cleared, no path key), so it will not trigger
    /// a rehydration offer. `purgeStaleZips` sweeps it on next launch. Deleting
    /// it here would be redundant and removes no user-visible benefit.
    ///
    /// ### `replaceItem` atomicity
    /// `FileManager.replaceItem` moves the old bundle aside as a named backup,
    /// moves the new bundle into place, then deletes the backup. If the process
    /// is killed mid-swap, macOS guarantees the bundle is either fully old or
    /// fully new.
