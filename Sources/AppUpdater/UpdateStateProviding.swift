// MARK: - UpdateStateProviding

/// The host-app state model that `AppUpdater` drives while an update is
/// discovered, downloaded, and installed.
///
/// `AppUpdater` owns none of the UI state itself — it mutates a conforming
/// object supplied by the host app (typically an `@Observable @MainActor`
/// view model). The host observes that object to render its own update UI.
///
/// ## Why the whole protocol is `@MainActor`
///
/// The conforming type is expected to be observed by SwiftUI/AppKit, both of
/// which require main-thread access. Annotating the entire protocol (not just
/// individual requirements) is required for Swift 6 strict concurrency: it
/// makes every requirement main-actor isolated so `AppUpdater` (also
/// `@MainActor`) can call them synchronously without cross-actor hops, and it
/// lets conforming `@MainActor` classes satisfy the protocol without extra
/// `nonisolated` juggling.
///
/// ## Why read-only properties + explicit mutation methods
///
/// The properties are `{ get }` only and all state changes go through named
/// methods. This prevents TOCTOU-shaped misuse: a caller cannot set
/// `updateZipURL` without also setting `cachedUpdateVersion`, because there is
/// no setter — the paired write is encapsulated in `setDownloadComplete`.
/// Each method names an intent (download started / completed / failed) rather
/// than exposing raw fields, keeping every write site auditable.
///
/// `isDownloading` is intentionally NOT part of this protocol. Whether a
/// spinner is shown is a host-app UI detail; `AppUpdater` tracks in-flight
/// downloads with its own instance flag. The host only needs the four mutation
/// hooks below to render a correct UI.
///
/// ## Why the protocol also refines `Sendable`
///
/// `AppUpdater.scheduleBackgroundCheck` captures the host-state existential in an
/// escaping `NSBackgroundActivityScheduler` closure that runs on a background
/// GCD queue. Refining `Sendable` makes `any UpdateStateProviding` safe to carry
/// across that boundary. This costs conformers nothing: every conformer is a
/// reference type isolated to `@MainActor` (the whole protocol is), and
/// global-actor-isolated classes are implicitly `Sendable`.

    ///
    /// Implementations must also clear `updateActionFailed` to avoid a
    /// simultaneous dual-failure state: if a prior session left
    /// `updateActionFailed = true` and the current release has no asset,

    /// protocol does not define.

    /// `version` was previously downloaded and still exists on disk.

    /// clear any stale `updateActionFailed` / `updateAssetMissing` flags from a
    /// prior session.
