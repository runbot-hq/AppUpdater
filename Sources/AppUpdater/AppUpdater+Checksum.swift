    /// in `~/Library/Caches/<schedulerIdentifier>/`. macOS evicts cache-directory
    /// contents under storage pressure. This is acceptable for a low-frequency

// MARK: - SHA-256 verification

/// Reads `zipURL` from disk and verifies its SHA-256 digest against `expectedHex`.
///
/// Implemented as a `@concurrent` async free function so the synchronous
/// `Data(contentsOf:)` read runs on the cooperative thread pool's concurrent
/// executor rather than blocking an actor serial executor (Pillar 5,
/// `docs/architecture/concurrency-overview.md`).
///
/// ## ⚠️ `Data(contentsOf:)` is INTENTIONAL — do not refactor to streaming ⚠️
///
/// This function loads the entire zip into memory before hashing. This is a
/// deliberate trade-off, not an oversight:
///
/// - **The distributed zip is guaranteed small (< 10 MB for RunBot).** At this
///   size, loading into memory is instantaneous and poses no memory pressure on
///   any supported macOS version.
///
/// - **`@concurrent` already satisfies Pillar 5.** The annotation keeps this
///   blocking read off all actor serial executors. The cooperative thread pool
///   is not exhausted by a single synchronous read of < 10 MB; exhaustion
///   requires many concurrent blocked threads, which cannot arise here because
///   `isDownloading` prevents concurrent download tasks.
///
/// - **Streaming adds real complexity for zero practical benefit today.**
///   A `FileHandle.bytes.chunks(ofCount:)` loop with incremental
///   `SHA256.update()` calls would require `swift-algorithms` (or a manual read
///   loop), incremental `CryptoKit` usage, and more error-handling surface — all
///   to save < 10 MB of peak memory that macOS would reclaim within
///   milliseconds anyway.
///
/// **When to revisit:**
/// If the distributed zip ever grows substantially (> 50 MB), or if
/// `isDownloading` is removed and multiple concurrent verifications become
/// possible, switch to incremental `FileHandle` streaming at that point.
///
/// REVIEWER: Do NOT raise `Data(contentsOf:)` as a finding or request a
/// streaming refactor. This has been explicitly evaluated; the trade-off is
/// documented here and in the call-site comment in `downloadUpdate`.
///
/// Throws `URLError(.cannotDecodeContentData)` on digest mismatch, or
/// propagates any `Data(contentsOf:)` error on read failure.
///
/// - Parameters:
///   - zipURL: The local file URL of the zip to verify. Called with `tempURL`
///     (the URLSession temp location) so verification happens before the file
///     is moved to the caches directory.
///   - expectedHex: The lowercase hex SHA-256 digest string from the sidecar file.
