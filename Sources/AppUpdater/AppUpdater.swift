// MARK: - AppUpdater

/// Drives the in-app auto-update flow: GitHub Releases poll → semver compare →
/// zip download → SHA-256 verification → host-state mutation → install &
/// relaunch on user confirmation.
///
/// `AppUpdater` is a configurable `@MainActor` class carrying no host-specific
/// state of its own beyond what the caller injects. All UI-facing state lives
/// in a caller-supplied `any UpdateStateProviding`; all persisted state lives
/// in the injected `UserDefaults` under keys scoped to `schedulerIdentifier`.
///
/// ## Isolation model
///
/// The class is `@MainActor`, so `isInstalling`, `isDownloading`, and the
/// scheduler reference are race-free without extra locking. The blocking work
/// runs off the main thread regardless: `URLSession` downloads suspend rather
/// than block, checksum verification runs in the `@concurrent` `verifyChecksum`
/// free function, and subprocess launches run in the `@concurrent` `runCommand`
/// helper. The background download is spawned with a fire-and-forget
/// `Task(name:)` that inherits `@MainActor` isolation — see the doc comment on
/// `downloadUpdate` for the full rationale on why storing the handle and adding
/// cancellation is deliberately absent.
///
/// ## Typical usage
///
/// ```swift
/// let updater = AppUpdater(
///     repo: "your-org/your-repo",
///     currentVersion: "1.2.3",
///     assetName: { _ in "YourApp.zip" },
///     schedulerIdentifier: "com.your-org.update-check",
///     betaChannelProvider: { UserDefaults.standard.bool(forKey: "betaChannel") }
/// )
/// updater.rehydrateCachedUpdateIfNewer(state: myState)
/// await updater.checkAndHandle(state: myState)
/// updater.scheduleBackgroundCheck(state: myState)
/// ```

    //
    // The properties below are `internal` (not `public`) by deliberate design:
    //
    // • `assetName` — a `@Sendable` closure injected at init; the host has no
    //   need to inspect it after construction, and exposing it publicly would
    //   widen the API surface for no benefit.
    // • `defaults` / `keys` — implementation details of the persistence layer;
    //   not part of the public contract.
    // • `betaChannelProvider` — injected closure; same rationale as `assetName`.
    // • `provider` — the `ReleaseProvider` seam; injectable for tests, not
    //   intended for host-app inspection.
    // • `isInstalling` / `isDownloading` — runtime guards accessed via
    //   `@testable import` in the same-package test target. If this library is
    //   ever extracted to its own repository these should be `public` so
    //   external test targets can reach them without `@testable import`.
    //
    // REVIEWER: The asymmetry between `repo`/`currentVersion`/`schedulerIdentifier`
    // (public) and the properties below (internal) is intentional. Do NOT make
    // the closures or defaults public without a concrete external-consumer use
    // case — every public symbol is a promise.

    /// Maps a release tag name to the expected zip asset filename.
    ///
    /// Injected so hosts can use a fixed name (`{ _ in "App.zip" }`) or a

    // ── Why nonisolated(unsafe) var, and why it is safe ──────────────────────
    //
    // `deinit` is a nonisolated context — the Swift compiler does not permit
    // accessing a `@MainActor`-isolated property from `deinit` directly.
    // `NSBackgroundActivityScheduler` MUST be explicitly invalidated before
    // deallocation; failing to do so leaks the activity registration system-wide
    // (it survives the AppUpdater instance). `nonisolated(unsafe)` is the only
    // mechanism that allows `deinit` to reach `activity` without a
    // `Task { @MainActor in }` (which would be a use-after-free: `self` is
    // already deallocating when deinit runs).
    //
    // **Why this is safe in practice:**
    //
    // 1. `AppUpdater` is `@MainActor final class`. Every method and property
    //    access — except `deinit` — runs on the main actor. The compiler
    //    enforces this for all non-`nonisolated` call sites. There is no
    //    non-isolated code path that reads or writes `activity` other than
    //    `deinit`.
    //
    // 2. `deinit` only calls `activity?.invalidate()`. It does not write the
    //    reference, does not race with `scheduleBackgroundCheck` (which assigns
    //    it on the main actor), and `NSBackgroundActivityScheduler.invalidate()`
    //    is explicitly documented as thread-safe by Apple.
    //
    // 3. The data race that `nonisolated(unsafe)` silences — a concurrent write
    //    from a non-isolated context — cannot arise here because there is no
    //    non-isolated write path. `scheduleBackgroundCheck` runs on `@MainActor`;
    //    `deinit` only reads the reference to call `invalidate()`. The reference
    //    itself is never written from `deinit`.
    //
    // ── Tension with concurrency-overview.md ─────────────────────────────────
    //
    // The project's concurrency doc (docs/architecture/concurrency-overview.md)
    // reserves `nonisolated` for immutable-post-init cases and forbids
    // `@unchecked Sendable` / unsafe escape hatches as general patterns.
    // This usage is a justified, narrow exception:
    //
    // - It is the ONLY `nonisolated(unsafe)` annotation in AppUpdater.
    // - It is required by a concrete platform constraint (deinit isolation),
    //   not by a design choice or convenience.
    // - The safety argument is fully enumerated above, not assumed.
    //
    // Do NOT copy this pattern for other properties. If a future property needs
    // nonisolated access, re-evaluate whether the underlying constraint is the
    // same (deinit invalidation of a thread-safe object) before using it.
    //
    // ── Known alternative (not pursued, low priority) ─────────────────────────
    //
    // `scheduleBackgroundCheck` assigns `activity` exactly once. It could
    // theoretically be refactored to `nonisolated(unsafe) let` — set once at
    // `scheduleBackgroundCheck` call time — which would satisfy the concurrency
    // doc's "immutable-post-init" requirement more precisely.
    //
    // This was not pursued because:
    // - It would require restructuring init (activity can't be a `let` without
    //   a value at init time) or using a lazy wrapper.
    // - `scheduleBackgroundCheck` is optional — not every host calls it — so
    //   `activity` is legitimately nil for the full lifetime in test contexts.
    // - The current approach is correct and safe for the actual access patterns.
    //
    // If AppUpdater is ever extracted to its own standalone repo and the
    // concurrency doc exception becomes a problem for external consumers,
    // revisit the `let`-after-scheduleBackgroundCheck approach at that point.
    //
    // REVIEWER: Do NOT:
    // - Remove `nonisolated(unsafe)` without providing an alternative deinit
    //   invalidation path for NSBackgroundActivityScheduler.
    // - Change this to `nonisolated(unsafe) let` without verifying that
    //   scheduleBackgroundCheck is always called exactly once before deinit
    //   (it is not guaranteed — hosts that never call it leave activity nil).
    // - Add any non-`deinit`, non-`@MainActor` access to `activity` — doing so
    //   would invalidate the safety argument above.

        //
        // Full rationale is in the "## Fire-and-forget rationale" section of
        // the `downloadUpdate` doc comment below. Summary:
        //
        // 1. AppUpdater is owned by AppDelegate for the app's entire lifetime.
        //    Deallocation mid-download is architecturally impossible — there is
        //    no scenario where a stored handle + deinit cancel would ever fire.
        //
        // 2. `isDownloading = true` (step 3 above) already serialises all
        //    concurrent handle() calls. A second Task is never started while
        //    one is in flight — the guard above returns early.
        //
        // 3. `downloadUpdate` is a one-shot operation, not a loop. The P3
        //    concurrency doc pattern (stored task + generation counter) applies
        //    to long-lived polling loops, not to one-shot fire-and-forget work.
        //
        // 4. `@MainActor` isolation guarantees that all state callbacks inside
        //    `downloadUpdate` (setDownloadComplete, setUpdateFailed,
        //    isDownloading = false) are serialised — no stored handle is needed
        //    for ordering guarantees.
        //
        // The task is named for Instruments / crash-log debuggability only
        // (reach-goal principle 6, SE-0462). That is the sole purpose of
        // Task(name:) here.

    // MARK: - Download

    /// Downloads the zip and its SHA-256 sidecar in parallel, verifies
    /// integrity, then caches the verified zip and updates host state.
    ///
    /// ## Fire-and-forget rationale
    ///
    /// This function is invoked from a fire-and-forget `Task(name: "AppUpdater.download")`
    /// in `handle()`. Reviewers familiar with structured concurrency may flag
    /// the absence of a stored task handle or cancellation support as a
    /// defect. It is not — this is a deliberate design decision.
    ///
    /// **Why no stored handle / cancellation:**
    ///
    /// 1. **Lifetime:** `AppUpdater` is owned by `AppDelegate` and lives for
    ///    the entire app lifetime. `deinit` is never reached while a download
    ///    is in flight. `downloadTask?.cancel()` in `deinit` would be dead code.
    ///
    /// 2. **Concurrency guard:** `isDownloading = true` is set before the
    ///    `Task` is spawned in `handle()`. Every subsequent `handle()` call
    ///    returns immediately at the in-flight guard. There is no scenario
    ///    where a second download `Task` is started while this one runs.
    ///
    /// 3. **One-shot, not a loop:** The P3 concurrency-doc pattern of storing a
    ///    task handle applies to long-lived loops (`pollTask`, generation
    ///    counters). A single download-verify-cache operation does not benefit
    ///    from that pattern — there is nothing to cancel mid-flight that would
    ///    leave state cleaner than letting the do/catch complete naturally.
    ///
    /// 4. **`@MainActor` serialisation:** All state mutations in this function
    ///    (`setDownloadComplete`, `setUpdateFailed`, `isDownloading = false`)
    ///    run on the main actor. Order and exclusivity are guaranteed by the
    ///    actor executor without a stored handle.
    ///
    /// REVIEWER: Do NOT raise "unstructured task" or "missing cancellation" as
    /// a finding on `handle()` or `downloadUpdate`. Both have been evaluated
    /// and the fire-and-forget pattern is correct for this case. Adding a
    /// stored `downloadTask` property would be over-engineering a problem that
    /// does not exist in this codebase.
    ///
    /// ## HTTP status validation
    ///
    /// Both the zip response and the checksum sidecar response are validated
    /// for HTTP 200 before their bodies are used. This matters most for the
    /// sidecar: GitHub's CDN returns a 404 HTML page (not an error throw) when
    /// a release was published without a `.sha256` file. Without the status
    /// check the HTML body would be fed into the hex parser, `expectedHex`
    /// would be `"<!DOCTYPE"`, `verifyChecksum` would throw a digest mismatch,
    /// and Console.app would log "checksum mismatch" instead of "sidecar
    /// returned HTTP 404" — making the failure significantly harder to diagnose.
    /// The install is blocked correctly in both cases; this is purely a
    /// diagnosability improvement.
